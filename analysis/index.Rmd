## Introduction

This analysis compares the binding sites of AR, FOXA1, GATA3 and TFAP2B in MDA-MB-453 cells.
All ChIP targets were obtained from separate experiments using Vehicle as the reference condition and DHT-treatment as the key response under investigation.
Given the mostly cytoplasmic location of AR in Vehicle, the primary comparison will be performed using DHT-treated samples.
For all targets, the cistrome is largely conserved across conditions.
Analysis using the GRAVI workflow is available [here](https://github.com/DRMCRL/GRAVI_MDA-MB-453_AR_GATA3_FOXA1_TFAP2B) (for those given access)
